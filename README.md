About
====================
A stroke font that can be used for displaying debug information on the SONY
Playstation when your TRAM is hosed or not yet set up.

This version of the software was explicitly developed for the SONY PSX but
would be trivial to port to any other platform with line drawing capabilities.

My earliest implementation of this idea  is from 1978 or 1979 when I first
started developing video games. There have been many iterations of the font and
underyling code that has been implemented on pretty much any platform I've ever 
developed for from the Acorn Atom all the way up to the XBOX 360.

   
Pre-requisites
